# Julia Users NZ

This site co-ordinates [Julia](https://julialang.org) events in New Zealand. To be in the loop, sign up [for the mailing list below](#mailing-list).

### Upcoming events

Nothing right now, but see [previous meetups](#previous-meetups).

### Who uses Julia in NZ?

One reason for starting this group is to gain visibility into some of the cool
stuff people are doing with Julia in New Zealand.

- Oscar ([@odow](https://github.com/odow), Auckland) is a core contributor of
    [JuMP](https://jump.dev).
- Morten ([@mortenpi](https://github.com/mortenpi), Auckland) is a Ph.D. student
    at U. Massey, Albany, and maintains [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl)
    as a side project.
- Anthony ([@ablaom](https://github.com/ablaom), Auckland) is a mathematician and senior research fellow at the University of Auckland, computer science. He is the co-creator and lead developer of the machine learning toolbox [MLJ.jl](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/MLJ.jl).
- Joachim ([@joachimbrand](https://github.com/joachimbrand), Auckland) is a physicist at Massey University. He develops the quantum Monte Carlo package [Rimu.jl](https://github.com/joachimbrand/Rimu.jl) with his research group and collaborators.
- Elke ([@ElkePahl](https://github.com/ElkePahl), Auckland) is a computational condensed-matter physicist at Auckland University. She develops a parallel-tempering Monte Carlo package [ParallelTemperingMonteCarlo.jl](https://github.com/ElkePahl/ParallelTemperingMonteCarlo.jl) with her research group using Julia. She is also collaborator on the `Rimu.jl` project.
- Ashton ([@AshtonSBradley](https://github.com/AshtonSBradley), Dunedin) is a physicist at the University of Otago. He has authored [VortexDistributions.jl](https://github.com/AshtonSBradley/VortexDistributions.jl) and [PhaseSpaceTools.jl](https://github.com/AshtonSBradley/PhaseSpaceTools.jl).

### Previous meetups

- **Julia NZ Meetup #1:** The Julia NZ kick-off event took place at the Department of Physics of the University of Auckland on 2 December 2020! Many thanks for people who joined!
- **Julia NZ Meetup #2:** 21 January 2021, with Dr. Ashton Bradley from the Department of Physics, University of Otago, giving a talk about his experience of using Julia for teaching 300-level computational physics courses and for physics research, with examples from packages he has written: [VortexDistributions.jl](https://github.com/AshtonSBradley/VortexDistributions.jl) and [PhaseSpaceTools.jl](https://github.com/AshtonSBradley/PhaseSpaceTools.jl).
- **Julia NZ Meetup #3:** 14 April 2021 at the University of Auckland featuring a talk by [Dr. Anthony Blaom](https://github.com/ablaom) from the University of Auckland & the Alan Turning Institute talking about [MLJ.jl](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/dev/).
- **Julia NZ Meetup #4:** 10 June 2021 at GridAKL featuring a talk by [Dr. Oscar Dowson](https://github.com/odow) on [JuMP](https://jump.dev/) -- a modeling language for mathematical optimization.
- **JuliaCon 2022 NZ Meetup:** 28 July 2022 at Massey University
