# Julia Users NZ

This site co-ordinates [Julia](https://julialang.org) events in New Zealand. To be in the loop, sign up [for the mailing list below](#mailing-list).

### Who uses Julia in NZ?

One reason for starting this group is to gain visibility into some of the cool
stuff people are doing with Julia in New Zealand.
